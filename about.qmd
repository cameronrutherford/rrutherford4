This repo will mainly focus on the home page for me and the courses I teach.

It's written in Quarto, with CI maintained by GitHub.

## Structure

While not sticking to it explicitly, I will try and follow [diataxis](https://diataxis.fr)
as a principle.

### Developer Guide

Information related to how I maintain these docs with CI, and how you could DIY.

### How-Tos

Since there will hopefully eventually be some shared information re-used across
classes, I will store some general useful advice and How-Tos here.

### HomePage

About me, and links to things like GoogleScholar, LinkedIn, GitHub and more...

If I ever make explanation that is independent of a class, it will go here.

Will include a RevealJS presentation!

### Classes (Tutorials)

Each class will have it's own set of pages including a homepage with:

- Lecture materials (on GitHub/Google or otherwise)
- Syllabus
- Calendar invites
- Code repositories
- Blackboard and other resources
